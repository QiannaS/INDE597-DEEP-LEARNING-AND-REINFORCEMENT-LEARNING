# Convolutional neural networks

## Introduction

A basic convnet is a stack of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers.
The convnet has two characters :
  * The patterns they learn are translation-invariant.
  * They can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns
 
 We can use the convnet to optimize the model (reduce overfitting)
