# Convolutional neural networks

## Introduction

A basic convnet is a stack of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers.
The convnet has two characters :
  * The patterns they learn are translation-invariant.
  * They can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns
 
 We can use the convnet to optimize the model (reduce overfitting)
 
# Tool
KERAS

# Model

Sequential model
(Actually, we can also add convnet on functional api)
In this case, we use convnet to help build a sequential model.

# DATA
MNIST
