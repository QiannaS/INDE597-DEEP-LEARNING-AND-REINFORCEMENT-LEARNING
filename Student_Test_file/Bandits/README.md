# Bandits Problem

## Introduction
Multi-armed bandit problems are some of the simplest reinforcement learning (RL) problems to solve. We have an agent which we allow to choose actions, and each action has a reward that is returned according to a given, underlying probability distribution. The game is played over many episodes (single actions in this case) and the goal is to maximize your reward.
