## Training a convnet from scratch on a small dataset

In this section, we’ll review one basic strategy to tackle this problem: training a new model from scratch using what little data you have. We’ll start by naively training a small convnet on the 2,000 training samples, without any regularization, to set a base- line for what can be achieved. This will get us to a classification accuracy of about 70%. At that point, the main issue will be overfitting.
