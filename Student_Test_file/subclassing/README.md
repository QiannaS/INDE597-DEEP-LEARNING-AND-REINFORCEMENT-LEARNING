# Model Subclassing

## Introduction
The last model-building pattern you should know about is the most advanced one: Model subclassing. 

* In the __init__() method, define the layers the model will use.
* In the call() method, define the forward pass of the model, reusing the layers
previously created.
 * Instantiate your subclass, and call it on data to create its weights.
